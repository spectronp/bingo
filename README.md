# Custom Bingo
> Make your own bingo

This is the first and most simple version of the app. With time, I will add more features and improve it so it becomes better and less ugly.\
Feel free to make improvements suggestions and let me know of any bug you find at the [issues page](https://github.com/spectronp/bingo/issues). You can also send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/spectronp/bingo/pulls)

## How to Play

2. Write one item per line in the text area
3. Click the `Grid` button
4. Click the items to mark them, if you want to edit the items you can click the `Edit` button
